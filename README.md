Abstractâ€” Advanced imitation learning with structures like
the transformer is increasingly demonstrating its advantages
in robotics. However, deploying these large-scale models on
embedded platforms remains a major challenge. In this paper,
we propose a pipeline that facilitates the migration of advanced
imitation learning algorithms to edge devices. The process is
achieved via an efficient model compression method and a
practical asynchronous parallel method Temporal Ensemble
with Dropped Actions (TEDA) that enhances the smoothness
of operations. To show the efficiency of the proposed pipeline,
large-scale imitation learning models are trained on a server
and deployed on an edge device to complete various manipulation tasks.
